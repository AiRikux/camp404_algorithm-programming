# Camp 404 Algorithm and Programming
 I am taking Camp 404 Algorithm and Programming bootcamp where we learn about the logic of algorithms as well as basic Python. 
 
 Their classes consist of:
 1. Introduction to Algorithm and Programming
    * consist of theoritical discussion about algorithms

 2. Solving Simple Problems
    * conditions.py

 3. Functions and Data Processing
    * conditions.py
 
 4. Searching and Sorting
    * search.py
    * sort.py

The class go through different technique of search and sort which is good for starting to learn about algorithm. I have completed the final exam with a score of 88/100.
